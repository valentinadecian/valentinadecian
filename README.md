## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I landed on GitHub to create a sort of portfolio with some data science projects.

I have a master's degree in mathematics and have been passionate about data science and machine learning for a couple of years, so I've taken several DataCamp courses and even obtained several certifications.

I prefer using Python as my programming language and am familiar with data science-specific libraries such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch. Lately I've been diving into pre-trained AI models (Hugging Face).

I'm going to use this profile to make some practice with some real world scenarios and present my results, thus integrating my theoretical studies with some practice! ðŸš€
